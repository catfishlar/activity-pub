## Setting up for PXE Boot

Reference: 
 * How to enable Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE boot) in BIOS? https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000054990/intel-nuc/intel-nuc-kits.html
   Unfortunately my nuc doesn't isn't set up exactly as they suggest. Still PXE boot is an OLD thing so.. 

No boot file recieved..
