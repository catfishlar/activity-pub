# Activity Pub

This repo is to capture my notes on building out Mastodon et al, instances.  

Started really looking at this at the end of November 2022, but really got to 
were I wanted to spin up my cluster again and get some stuff running on Dec 6, 2022.   

The Elon Twitter shock, sent a lot of people looking for new homes.  Many came to 
Mastodon, many many new servers, not a comensurate increase in chat so we'll see 
what this means.   https://fediverse.observer/stats

At a minimum there is a lot of need for admins, and its 
going to be a time of lots of chat about how to set these things up and 
how work out the problems. So I am IN.  

## Me

I landed on @larry@urbanists.social because one of the more pleasurable things 
I did on twitter was to read about urban planning and YIMBY stuff. 

A couple days later I found that I was really drinking pretty heavily from
the content on hachyderm.io and so I also became @larry@hachyderm.io where 
at first twitter had been my place to see tech stuff.
