This repo is to capture my notes on building out Mastodon et al, instances.  

Started really looking at this at the end of November 2022, but really got to 
were I wanted to spin up my cluster again and get some stuff running on Dec 6, 2022.   

The Elon Twitter shock, sent a lot of people looking for new homes.  Many came to 
Mastodon, many many new servers, not a comensurate increase in chat so we'll see 
what this means.   https://fediverse.observer/stats

At a minimum there is a lot of need admins, and its 
going to be a time of lots of chat about how to set these things up and 
how work out the problems. So I am IN.
