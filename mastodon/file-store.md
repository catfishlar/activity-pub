# File Store Options

File Store holds Profile Pictures and Media Attachments 
to posts.   

This tends to be much bigger than the Database store
and can be managed via your NGinx proxy to be somewhere else.
Can even be heirarchical. 

For example 
>       Media usage after 5 days:
>        Attachments:    43.3 GB
>        Custom emoji:   120 MB
>        Preview cards:  999 MB
>        Avatars:        3.22 GB
>        Headers:        7.33 GB
