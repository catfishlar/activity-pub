You can get a servers block list via API.  For example 

    https://soc.jrconlin.com/api/v1/instance/domain_blocks

If you want to know why a place is blocked in that list you could look at the FediBlock list https://joinfediverse.wiki/FediBlock

For example @jrconlin's list I see witches.live.  I kinda like witches.  I didn't get to their local and see whats really inside, but the rules and general attitude seemed chaotic good.
